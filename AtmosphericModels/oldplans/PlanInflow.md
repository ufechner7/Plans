# Extend the inflow conditions

## Background
The following fields must be present in Settings in KiteUtils, and the new profile_law s 4,5 and 6 must be implemented

```julia
Base.@kwdef struct InflowConditions
    wind_speed::Float64      # in m/s at 6 m height
    wind_direction::Float64  # in degrees, 0 = North, 90 = East
    profile_law::Int64       # 0=CONST, 1=EXP, 2=LOG, 3=EXPLOG, 4=CUSTOM_LOG, 5=CUSTOM_EXP, 6=CUSTOM_JET
    # the custom profiles are fitted using the heights and speeds given in the heights and speeds fields
    # CUSTOM_JET: u(z) = u_bg(z) + U_J * exp(-(z - z_c)^2 / (2*sigma^2))
    # the following fields are optional; the defaults given below are the server defaults
    alpha::Float64 = 0.08163                # exponent of the wind profile law
    z0::Float64 = 0.0002                    # surface roughness                                     [m]
    turbulence::Float64 = 0.0               # in [0, 1], 0 = no turbulence, 1 = full turbulence
    heights::Vector{Float64} = [6.0]        # heights at which the wind speed is given
    speeds::Vector{Float64} = [wind_speed]  # wind speeds at the given heights
end
```

## Step 1: Add missing fields to settings.yaml in the section environment
In KiteUtils,
- add the missing comments to profile_law
- add the fields heights and speeds
- add the missing fields to the Settings struct in settings.jl
- add tests
- run the tests using Kaimon
- an invalid integer value for profile_law must be detected and must result in an error message when loading the yaml file

## Step 2a: Add two missing functions to AtmosphericModels
- add functions for 4=CUSTOM_LOG, 5=CUSTOM_EXP, 6=CUSTOM_JET
- custom_log and custom_exp should apply the log and the exp law; the coefficient shall be derived by minimizing
  the mean square error from the heights and speeds vectors
- add the example plot_custom_exp_log that shows two curves and dots to visualize that the approximation works
- add tests

## Step 2b: Add custom_jet function
Use the following formula:
    # CUSTOM_JET: u(z) = u_bg(z) + U_J * exp(-(z - z_c)^2 / (2*sigma^2))
and determine the coefficients with a least square fit.

- add an example
- add a test

Please note: a low level jet might be at 200m height. From 200 to 300m height the 
speed must drop.
