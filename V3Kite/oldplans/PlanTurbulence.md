# Allow to use a turbulent wind field

Use `AtmosphericModels.calc_turbulent_wind` (new in 0.3.6) to add Mann-model turbulence to the V3
kite simulation, and add a `set_default_turbulence` entry to `examples/menu2.jl`.

## Why this is not a copy of the KiteModels approach

`KiteModels.jl` writes the turbulent wind straight into the model state: `set_v_wind_ground!`
(`src/KiteModels.jl:220-236`) assigns `s.v_wind` and `s.v_wind_tether`, and the hand-written
residual reads those fields.

V3Kite has no such fields. Wind enters the ModelingToolkit DAE built by `SymbolicAWEModels`:

- `wind_vec_gnd ~ get_wind_vec(psys)` reads `set.wind_vec` (`generate_system/scalar_eqs.jl:41`),
- every wing, tether segment and point multiplies it by
  `calc_wind_factor(am, x, y, z, psys)` (`generate_system/helpers.jl:101-115`), which is
  `@register_symbolic`, **height-only and time-independent**.

Consequences that shape this plan:

1. `set.wind_vec` is a *ground* vector that gets scaled by the profile factor at every position.
   Overwriting it with the turbulent wind at the kite would double-count the profile law and apply
   the kite's turbulence to the whole tether. **Do not do that.**
2. The only per-body wind hook that exists today is `wing.wind_disturb`, a mutable `KVec3` on the
   wing struct (`system_structure/wing.jl:153`) read via `get_wind_disturb(psys, idx)` and added to
   the wing's apparent wind (`generate_system/scalar_eqs.jl:52-55`). That is the injection point.
3. The disturbance must therefore be the **deviation from the mean wind**, not the wind itself.
4. It is updated once per `step!` and held constant during the solve. This is required, not a
   shortcut: `get_wind` is a nearest-grid-point lookup, so making it a function of the DAE's `t`
   would put a discontinuous, non-differentiable term inside the Newton/BDF stages.

Tether turbulence is **out of scope**: `generate_system/segment_eqs.jl:175` has no disturbance term,
so the second return value of `calc_turbulent_wind` (`v_wind_tether`) has nowhere to go. See
"Follow-up" below.

## Step 1 — dependency (done)

`AtmosphericModels` 0.3.6 exports `calc_turbulent_wind`.

- `Project.toml`: `AtmosphericModels` compat bumped `"0.3.4"` → `"0.3.6"`, so a resolve cannot
  silently land on 0.3.5, where `calc_turbulent_wind` does not exist.
- `Manifest-v1.12.toml` and `Manifest-v1.12.toml.default` both pin 0.3.6 and match each other.

## Step 2 — one shared `AtmosphericModel` (done)

Today two atmospheric models are built from the same settings:

- `V3KITE.am = AtmosphericModel(set)` — [src/interface.jl:69](src/interface.jl#L69)
- `sys_struct.am = AtmosphericModel(set)` — `SymbolicAWEModels/src/system_structure/system_structure_core.jl:954`

With `use_turbulence > 0` **both eagerly load a wind field**, and a wind field for the configured
grid is 1.24 GB on disk (`windfield_4050_100_500_70_1.0_8.2.npz`) — i.e. ~2.5 GB of RAM for two
copies of the same data.

Fix applied: the `V3KITE` field default is now `am::AtmosphericModel = sam.am`
([src/interface.jl:76](src/interface.jl#L76)). `sam.am` forwards to `sam.sys_struct.am`
(`symbolic_awe_model.jl:190-191`), so every construction site shares the DAE's instance — not just
`init`, but also the bare `V3KITE(set=..., kcu=..., sam=...)` form used in `test/test-interface.jl`.
Sharing is safe because the live `sys_struct` (and its `am`) is always built in-process: only
`full_sys` comes from the `.bin` cache, and the deserialized problem's parameters are re-pointed at
the current `sys_struct` (`model_management.jl:423`).

Verified in the REPL: `s.am === sam.sys_struct.am` and `s.set === s.am.set` are both `true`, and
`test/test-interface.jl` passes (60 + 23 + 26 tests).

## Step 3 — feed the turbulent deviation into the wing (done)

Implemented as `update_turbulence!(s::V3KITE)`
([src/interface.jl:644-679](src/interface.jl#L644-L679)), called from `step!` right after the
optional live wind update and before `sim_step!`
([src/interface.jl:703](src/interface.jl#L703)):

```julia
function update_turbulence!(s::V3KITE)
    # `upwind_dir` must be qualified here and in `step!`: the keyword argument of `step!`
    # shadows the V3Kite function of the same name.
    ud = V3Kite.upwind_dir(s)   # NaN if the wind vector has no horizontal component
    for wing in s.sys.wings
        if s.set.use_turbulence > 0 && isfinite(ud)
            pos = wing.pos_w
            v_turb, _ = calc_turbulent_wind(s.am, pos, s.sys_state.time; upwind_dir = ud)
            v_mean = calc_wind_factor(s.am, max(1.0, pos[3])) * s.set.wind_vec
            wing.wind_disturb .= v_turb .- v_mean
        else
            wing.wind_disturb .= 0.0
        end
    end
    nothing
end
```

Differences from the sketch this plan originally carried: it loops over all wings instead of
hardcoding `wings[1]`, it guards against a `NaN` upwind direction (zero horizontal wind) rather than
letting `NaN` propagate into the solve, and the zeroing branch is part of the same function.

Details that must not drift:

- **Position**: use `wing.pos_w`, the position the DAE itself uses for the wing wind, *not*
  `pos_kite(s)` ([src/interface.jl:190](src/interface.jl#L190), a bridle-point average). The mean
  subtracted here has to be the mean the DAE adds back, or the deviation does not cancel.
- **Height clamp**: `max(1.0, pos[3])` matches `SymbolicAWEModels`' `calc_wind_factor`;
  `calc_turbulent_wind` applies its own `MIN_KITE_HEIGHT` clamp internally. They differ only within
  a few metres of the ground.
- **Profile law**: call the two-argument `calc_wind_factor(am, height)`, which defaults to
  `set.profile_law` — the same value `get_wind` uses (`windfield.jl:333`). Never hardcode a law.
- **Angle units**: use `upwind_dir(s)` ([src/interface.jl:234](src/interface.jl#L234)), which returns
  **radians**, as `calc_turbulent_wind` expects. Note `set.upwind_dir` is in degrees and is converted
  with `deg2rad` at [src/interface.jl:690](src/interface.jl#L690) — do not pass it directly.
- **Time**: `s.sys_state.time` is monotonically increasing and starts at 0; `get_wind` asserts
  `t >= 0` and `z >= 5`.
- Reset `wing.wind_disturb` to zero when `use_turbulence == 0` is toggled at runtime (it is a
  persistent field on the struct).

`wing.pos_w` is refreshed from the integrator at the end of every step by
`update_sys_struct!` (`symbolic_awe_model.jl:474, 568`), and that function does *not* touch
`wind_disturb` — so the position read here is current and the injected disturbance survives the step.

Verified so far:

- `test/test-interface.jl` passes with the new call in `step!` (60 + 23 + 26 tests) — this exercises
  the `use_turbulence == 0` path, including the `V3Kite.upwind_dir(s)` qualification.
- The injection path itself was checked directly against the DAE: with
  `wing.wind_disturb = [1, 0, 0]` and one `sim_step!`, the residual of
  `va_b - R_b_to_w' * (v_wind - vel_w + wind_disturb)` is 5.4e-10, while dropping the
  `wind_disturb` term leaves exactly 1.0. The disturbance reaches the wing's apparent wind unchanged.
- The `use_turbulence > 0` path was verified once step 4 had generated a field — see there. It
  needed one more fix to work at all: `init` must re-point `am.set` at the live settings.

Optionally log `norm(wing.wind_disturb)` to a spare `sys_state` slot in `update_sys_state!` so the
turbulence is visible in the plots.

## Step 4 — wind fields for the V3 wind speeds (done)

`load_windfield` snaps to the **closest** entry of `set.v_wind_gnds` (`windfield.jl:117-121`), while
`get_wind` computes the mean wind from `set.v_wind` (`windfield.jl:333`), so a speed that is not in
the list borrows a neighbour's turbulence over its own mean wind.

Measured cost of that snap, for `settings_reelout.yaml` (turbulence intensity at 99 m, computed as
`rel_turb * calc_sigma1(am, v) / (v * calc_wind_factor(am, 99))`):

| `v_wind_gnds` | `rel_turbs` | I₉₉ |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 3.483 | 0.342 | 9.7 % |
| 5.324 | 0.465 | 10.4 % |
| 8.163 | 0.583 | 10.7 % |
| 9.51 | *0.583, snapped* | 10.1 % |
| 15.4 | *0.583, snapped* | 8.6 % |

Two things this corrects: V3Kite uses `alpha = 0.08163` rather than Cabauw's 0.234, yet the Cabauw
`rel_turbs` still land close to the intended intensity (9.7 / 10.4 / 10.7 % against the measured
8.5 / 9.7 / 9.8 %); and the snapping penalty at 9.51 m/s is only ~6 % relative — it is 15.4 m/s,
where the intensity falls to 8.6 %, that is really mis-served.

Done:

1. `v_wind_gnds` extended to `[3.483, 5.324, 8.163, 9.51]` and `rel_turbs` to
   `[0.342, 0.465, 0.583, 0.626]` in all three settings files (`settings.yaml`,
   `settings_reelout.yaml`, `settings_cabauw.yaml`), which share `alpha`, `avg_height`, `i_ref` and
   `h_ref` and therefore share one set of field files.
2. The new `rel_turb` is **not** a free parameter — per `AtmosphericModels/docs/src/wind_field.md`
   these are correction factors calibrated against measured Cabauw intensities, and the measured
   table stops at 8.163 m/s. 0.626 continues the log fit `rel_turb = 0.342 + 0.283*(ln v - 1.248)`,
   which reproduces the three calibrated points almost exactly (successive slopes 0.290 and 0.276).
   It puts I₉₉ at 10.9 % for 9.51 m/s, continuing the 9.7 → 10.4 → 10.7 % trend. A comment in each
   settings file records this.
3. Fields generated into `v3_data_path()` for 8.163 (covers the settings default `v_wind: 8.0`) and
   9.51 (the `simple_*`/`reel_out_v3`/`steering_test_v3` examples), 1.24 GB each:

   ```julia
   set_data_path(v3_data_path())
   set = load_settings("system_reelout.yaml"; relax=true)
   set.use_turbulence = 1.0
   am = AtmosphericModel(set; nowindfield=true)
   for v in (8.163, 9.51); new_windfield(am, v); end
   ```

   3.483 and 5.324 stay listed but have no pre-generated file; a run at those speeds triggers an
   on-the-fly `new_windfield` (`windfield.jl:109-112` only `@warn`s). 15.4 m/s is not covered at all
   and still snaps to 9.51.
4. **`grid:` added to all three settings files** as `[100, 4050, 500, 70]`. It was missing, and that
   is not cosmetic: `settle_wing` builds its settings with `KiteUtils.Settings(yaml)`, which does
   *not* fill defaults, so `set.grid` came out as `Int64[]` and `calc_basename`'s `set.grid[1]`
   threw a `BoundsError` that `WindField` swallows into "Error reading wind field!" plus a later
   `AssertionError: Wind field is not initialized`. `load_settings(...; relax=true)` hid the problem
   because it *does* fill the default — which is the same `[100, 4050, 500, 70]`, so declaring it
   explicitly keeps the generated filenames.
5. **`init` now re-points the atmospheric model at the live settings**
   ([src/interface.jl:613-621](src/interface.jl#L613-L621)):

   ```julia
   sam.am.set = set
   clear(sam.am)
   sam.am.wf = set.use_turbulence > 0 ? WindField(sam.am, set.v_wind) : nothing
   ```

   Without this, turbulence is silently a no-op whenever a cached settled geometry is used. The
   `.bin` is deserialized together with the `AtmosphericModel` it was serialized with, and
   `SystemStructure.am` is `const`, so `sys.set = set` in `settle_wing` cannot re-point it —
   confirmed in the REPL: `s.set === s.am.set` was `false`, and setting `s.set.use_turbulence = 1.0`
   left `s.am.set.use_turbulence == 0.0`. `update_turbulence!` would then call
   `calc_turbulent_wind`, which takes its *mean-wind* branch on the stale `use_turbulence == 0` and
   returns a disturbance of ≈0, with no field ever loaded. Reloading the field here is also required
   because it is selected by `set.v_wind`, which `init` has just changed.

   This staleness reaches beyond turbulence: the DAE's own `calc_wind_factor`/`calc_rho` read
   `am.set.alpha`/`z0`/`temp_ref` from the same object. Values normally agree because both copies
   come from the same YAML — they diverge exactly when the YAML is edited after the `.bin` was
   written. The fix here covers the `init` path; `settle_wing` used directly still has it.

**Grid**: `[100, 4050, 500, 70]` puts the **short** dimension first. This is exactly the layout the
0.3.6 `get_wind` fix handles (before it, dimension 1 was assumed to be the long, along-wind one), so
the step 1 compat floor is required for correctness here, not only for `calc_turbulent_wind`. It
also gives the basename `windfield_100_4050_500_70_*`, distinct from the
`windfield_4050_100_500_70_*` files in `AtmosphericModels/data`.

**Do not copy fields between packages.** The filename encodes only grid, `use_turbulence` and ground
wind speed — not `alpha`, `avg_height` or `i_ref`, all of which enter `calc_sigma1`. A file generated
under another package's settings would load without complaint and be silently wrong.

Note the filename also encodes `rel_sigma = set.use_turbulence` with one decimal
(`calc_full_name`, `windfield.jl:85-90`), so a non-default `use_turbulence` needs its own generated
set of files. `data/*.npz` is already in `.gitignore`.

Verified:

- Generation took 1m14s for both fields, 1,244,872,856 bytes each.
- Calibration closed empirically: sampling the generated 9.51 m/s field at a fixed point over 600 s
  gives I₉₉ = **10.8 %** against the 10.9 % predicted for `rel_turb = 0.626`; the same measurement on
  the 8.163 m/s field gives 11.0 % against 10.7 % predicted. No iteration on the factor was needed.
- **The `use_turbulence > 0` path now runs end to end**, closing the gap left open in step 3: with
  `use_turbulence: 1.0` temporarily set in `settings_reelout.yaml`,
  `init(9.51, 150.0; system_yaml="system_reelout.yaml")` loads the 9.51 m/s field, reports
  `rel_turb = 0.626` and `s.set === s.am.set`, and 200 steps run stably with
  `norm(wind_disturb)` between 0.27 and 3.27 m/s (mean 1.48), all finite.
- `test/test-interface.jl` still passes with `use_turbulence` back at 0.0 (60 + 23 + 26 tests).
- The flag was reverted to `0.0`; switching it on is step 5's job.

## Step 5 — `set_default_turbulence` (done)

Follow the pattern `KiteModels.jl` already uses (`src/KiteModels.jl:716-890`,
`examples/menu2.jl`, `test/test-default_turbulence.jl`): the value lives in **`data/gui.yaml`**, not
in the settings YAML. Any value in `[0.0, 1.0]` is accepted, and regenerating a wind field for a new
value is acceptable.

### Persistence

`data/gui.yaml` is the working copy, created on demand by copying the tracked
`data/gui.yaml.default` — the same `.default` convention V3Kite already uses for
`Manifest-v1.12.toml`. KiteModels' file is:

```yaml
gui:
    default_turbulence: 0.0              # default turbulence level for simulations, between 0.0 and 1.0
```

`.gitignore` needs `data/gui.yaml` (the `.default` stays tracked). While there: the two explicit
`data/windfield_*.npz` lines at the end should become `data/*.npz`, since new `use_turbulence`
values produce new filenames.

### API

Mirror KiteModels' pair, exported from `V3Kite`:

- `get_default_turbulence() -> Union{Float64, Nothing}` — reads `gui.yaml`, creating it from
  `gui.yaml.default` when missing.
- `set_default_turbulence(value::Union{Nothing,Real}=nothing) -> Union{Float64, Nothing}` — prompts
  on the terminal when called with no argument (`"Enter new default_turbulence [0.0..1.0] (blank to
  cancel): "`), rejects values outside `[0.0, 1.0]`, writes the file and returns the new value.

The write must preserve comments, so it is a line-based edit, not a `YAML.jl` round-trip. KiteModels
does this with two helpers, `update_yaml_scalar` and `insert_yaml_scalar_in_section`
(`src/KiteModels.jl:716-785`) — the second handles a `gui.yaml` that lacks the key entirely. They
are unexported internals of a package V3Kite does not depend on, so port them (~50 lines);
upstreaming them to `KiteUtils` later would remove the duplication for both packages.

### Applying the value

KiteModels' examples each do this themselves because they build `set` before constructing the model:

```julia
default_turbulence = get_default_turbulence()
if default_turbulence !== nothing
    set.use_turbulence = default_turbulence
end
```

V3Kite's examples never see a `Settings` — `init` builds it internally through `settle_wing` — so the
override belongs in `init`, immediately **before** the atmospheric-model sync added in step 4 (the
wind field is loaded there, and that decision reads `set.use_turbulence`):

```julia
turb = get_default_turbulence()
turb !== nothing && (set.use_turbulence = turb)
```

That makes `gui.yaml` the single source of truth for every example at once, and leaves
`use_turbulence: 0.0` in the settings YAMLs as the fallback for code paths that bypass `init`.

### Menu entry

`examples/menu2.jl` currently evaluates `"name = include(\"file.jl\")"` strings with
`eval(Meta.parse(...))`. That form **cannot** be reused here: `set_default_turbulence =
set_default_turbulence()` would bind the returned `Float64` over the function, so the second
invocation fails with "objects of type Float64 are not callable". KiteModels solved exactly this by
listing `(name, script_path)` tuples and treating `script_path === nothing` as "call the function"
(`KiteModels/examples/menu2.jl:36-56`). Restructure V3Kite's menu the same way, keeping the existing
`simple_*.jl` auto-discovery.

### The one-decimal trap

`calc_full_name` formats `rel_sigma = use_turbulence` with `%.1f` (`windfield.jl:85-90`), so 0.30 and
0.34 name the *same* file. Whichever field was generated first is then silently reused for the other
value, with a sigma error of up to ~15 %. `set_default_turbulence` should warn when
`round(value, digits=1) != value`. Fixing the encoding itself belongs in `AtmosphericModels`.

### Tests

`KiteModels/test/test-default_turbulence.jl` is directly portable: it works in a `mktempdir`, checks
that `gui.yaml` is created from `.default`, that `set_default_turbulence` round-trips, and that the
insert path works when the key is missing. It needs no wind field, so unlike the rest of this
feature it belongs in the regular suite.

### What was implemented

- `src/turbulence_config.jl` (new, included from `V3Kite.jl`): the two ported YAML helpers plus
  `gui_yaml_path`, `get_default_turbulence`, `set_default_turbulence`; the latter two exported.
- `data/gui.yaml.default` (tracked); `.gitignore` gained `data/gui.yaml` and its two explicit
  `windfield_*.npz` lines became `data/*.npz`.
- `init` applies the value ([src/interface.jl:613-617](src/interface.jl#L613-L617)), before the
  atmosphere sync.
- `examples/menu2.jl` restructured to `(label, script)` tuples with `nothing` = call the function.
- `test/test-default_turbulence.jl`, included from `runtests.jl`.

One deviation from KiteModels: all three functions take a `data_path` argument defaulting to
`get_data_path()`, and `init` passes its own `data_path`. `init` resolves every other read against
that argument on purpose — "`init` must not move the caller's KiteUtils data path, which outlives
the call" ([src/interface.jl:566-567](src/interface.jl#L566-L567)) — and a `gui.yaml` looked up in
the global path would have broken that contract.

Verified:

- `test/test-default_turbulence.jl`: 16 tests — creation from `.default`, round trip, comment
  preservation, rejection of out-of-range values, inclusive bounds, and the key-insert path.
- End to end through `init` in the real data path: `get_default_turbulence()` created `data/gui.yaml`
  from the `.default` (0.0); `set_default_turbulence(1.0)` then made `init` load the 9.51 m/s field
  with `use_turbulence = 1.0` and a first-step `norm(wind_disturb)` of 2.309; `set_default_turbulence(0.0)`
  brought it back to no field and a disturbance of 0.0. The trailing comment survived both edits.
- `test/test-interface.jl` still passes (60 + 23 + 26), and `examples/menu2.jl` parses.
- `data/gui.yaml` is left at `0.0`.

## Step 6 — verification

There is no CI test for this: a meaningful check needs a 1.24 GB wind field, which cannot live in
the test suite. Verify manually and record the numbers in the PR:

1. Run `examples/simple_parking.jl` (V_WIND = 9.51) with `use_turbulence` 0.0 and 1.0.
2. Confirm the run stays stable and note the realtime-factor change.
3. Compare the standard deviation of apparent wind speed and angle of attack between the two runs;
   with `use_turbulence = 1.0` the apparent-wind std should land near the intensity the field was
   calibrated to at the kite's height.
4. Sanity-check the sign convention: with `wind_disturb` forced to a constant, e.g. `[1, 0, 0]`, the
   apparent wind must shift east by 1 m/s.

## Documentation

- `CHANGELOG.md`: new entry — turbulent wind support at the kite, `use_turbulence` in
  `data/settings.yaml`, new `v_wind_gnds`/`rel_turbs` entries, `set_default_turbulence` menu item.
- `CLAUDE.md` / README wind section: document that turbulence is applied **at the wing only**, that
  it is piecewise constant per `step!`, and that wind fields must be generated once per
  (grid, `use_turbulence`, ground wind speed) combination.

## Follow-up (not in this plan)

Tether turbulence needs an upstream change in `SymbolicAWEModels`: a `wind_disturb` field on the
segment struct, a `get_wind_disturb(psys, segment_idx)` accessor, and an additive term in
`generate_system/segment_eqs.jl:175-179`, followed by a release. Only then can the `v_wind_tether`
return value of `calc_turbulent_wind` be used, giving parity with `KiteModels`.

## Address reviewer comments:
- gui.yaml shadows set.use_turbulence. init now silently overrides
the settings YAML, so editing use_turbulence: 1.0 there does nothing. A
turbulence=nothing kwarg on init falling back to the YAML gives the same
convenience without the second source of truth — and without
turbulence_config.jl.

a. I do not understand this comment. Can you explain it? I do think it would be good, in the set_default_turbulence function to be able to select "default" as alternative to a numerical value.

**Response — accepted as a defect, resolved differently (implemented).**

The defect is real. Two files held a turbulence level: `environment.use_turbulence` in the settings
YAML, and `gui.default_turbulence` in `data/gui.yaml`. `init` read the first and then overwrote it
with the second at `interface.jl:616-617`:

```julia
turb = get_default_turbulence(data_path)
turb !== nothing && (set.use_turbulence = turb)
```

The `!== nothing` guard looked like a fallback but never was one: `gui_yaml_path` *creates*
`gui.yaml` from `gui.yaml.default` when missing, so the getter practically always returned a
number and the settings YAML was dead. It went unnoticed because both files shipped `0.0` — they
agreed, so nothing looked wrong until someone changed one of them.

We did not take the `turbulence=nothing` kwarg, because it drops a feature the kwarg cannot
replace: `gui.yaml` is a gitignored, per-checkout preference that persists across REPL sessions and
applies to every example script without editing any of them. A kwarg is per-call. The problem was
never that `gui.yaml` exists — it was that `gui.yaml` had no way to say *"I have no opinion"*.

So `default_turbulence` now accepts the keyword `"default"` alongside a number:

- `get_default_turbulence` maps `"default"` to `nothing`, silently. `init` needs **no change** — it
  already treats `nothing` as "leave `set.use_turbulence` alone"; that branch was simply
  unreachable. `raw_default_turbulence` was added so callers can still tell the keyword apart from
  an unreadable file, since both read back as `nothing`.
- `set_default_turbulence("default")` persists it, and the interactive prompt accepts it too.
- **`gui.yaml.default` now ships `"default"`.** This is the part that actually fixes the reported
  defect: had the shipped value stayed numeric, a fresh checkout would still silently shadow the
  settings YAML for everyone who never calls `set_default_turbulence`, and the comment would stand.

Net effect: the settings YAML is authoritative by default, one source of truth as requested, and
overriding it from `gui.yaml` becomes a deliberate, per-checkout opt-in rather than the silent
default. `turbulence_config.jl` stays.

Verified: `test/test-default_turbulence.jl` covers the round trip, casing, and rejection of other
strings (25 tests pass). End to end, with `gui.yaml` set to `"default"` and the settings YAML at
`0.0`, `init` yields `set.use_turbulence == 0.0` and loads no wind field; with the settings YAML
temporarily at `1.0`, the same `init` yields `1.0` and loads the field — i.e. the YAML now drives
it, which is exactly what the comment asked for.

## Address second reviewer comment (done)
The two YAML helpers are copied from KiteModels.jl; rather upstream them
to KiteUtils now so you don't need the forked code.

Yes, please do that. Done: `update_yaml_scalar`/`insert_yaml_scalar_in_section` now live in
`KiteUtils` (`src/yaml_utils.jl`, released as v0.11.13). `Project.toml`'s `KiteUtils` compat was
bumped to `0.11.13`, the forked copies were deleted from `src/turbulence_config.jl`, and its two
call sites now use `KiteUtils.update_yaml_scalar`/`KiteUtils.insert_yaml_scalar_in_section`.

## Improve set_default_turbulence (done)
The dialog to select a number or default should work similar to select_sim_time.jl of the repo SimpleKiteControllers.jl.

Done: `set_default_turbulence()`'s no-argument path now shows a `RadioMenu`
(`REPL.TerminalMenus`, added as a `V3Kite` dependency) with `"default"` / `"specific value in
[0.0, 1.0]..."` / `"quit"`, mirroring `select_sim_time.jl`'s `select_sim_time`. The numeric branch
delegates to a new `ask_default_turbulence()`, mirroring `ask_sim_time_seconds`: it loops on
`Base.prompt`, re-asking on an out-of-range or unparsable value and returning `nothing` on a blank
line. `test/test-default_turbulence.jl` still passes 25/25 (it only exercises the value-argument
path, so the interactive rewrite added no test surface).

## Cleanup comments (done)

Apply the following rules to the files interface.jl and turbulence_config.jl.

- Inline comments are ONLY allowed when stating a very non-obvious fact, and
  then keep them to 1 line at most. Give every type/function a docstring ("""
  not #) instead, but not too verbose, people won't reed it if your docstring is
  too long, and explain how the code works in the docstring, but not the whole
  story behind it.
- Remove or make inline comments 1 line where you see them.

Done: moved several multi-line explanatory comments in `interface.jl` into the
relevant docstrings (`WinchPosController`, `init`, `step!`), added a missing
docstring to `calc_orient_quat`, and condensed or removed the rest (several were
fully redundant with an existing docstring). `turbulence_config.jl`'s 17-line
top-of-file comment block was removed as duplicate of the function docstrings
below it. Verified: both files still parse and the full suite passes
(358/358 tests).

## Address reviewer comment (done)
- Move the keepers of this document (why not the KiteModels approach, the rel_turb calibration table, the one-decimal filename trap) into the PR body and CHANGELOG.md.
- Move PlanTurbulence.md to the Plan repo, folder V3Kite/oldplans

Done: the three keepers are now in `CHANGELOG.md`'s `## Unreleased` section
(`Added`/`Fixed`/`Notes`) and in [PR #44's body](https://github.com/OpenSourceAWE/V3Kite.jl/pull/44).
This file has moved to `Plans/V3Kite/oldplans/PlanTurbulence.md` and was
removed from the V3Kite repo.
